# Logging with Splunk

A centralized logging facility makes observability easy by providing a one-stop shop for
investigating, analyzing and tracking logs. This becomes increasingly important to have as
applications grow larger and more distributed.

We're using Splunk for this example application. Splunk is a popular tool used in the enterprised
for ingesting logs from nearly anything into one place.

See our [README](./README.md) for more information on starting it.
