# Contino's SRE Webinar App

This is the app that we used for the SRE webinar. Start it by running
`./start_app.sh`.

You can access the app by navigating your web browser to http://localhost.

There are several branches describing the various stages of SRE-ifying this app.
To see them, execute `git branch -a`. To start the app in any of these branches,
add `BRANCH=<branch_name>` before `./start_app.sh`.
